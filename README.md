## üöÄ What's Inside?

This repository is structured to guide you from foundational knowledge to building and deploying sophisticated AI applications and agents on Google Cloud:

1.  **[Comprehensive Research Report](COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md)**
    * Provides a detailed overview of the AI landscape on Google Cloud, the rationale behind the learning path, and deep dives into key concepts, technologies, and best practices.

2.  **[AI Engineer Learning Path](ROADMAP.md)**
    * A phase-by-phase roadmap outlining the modules, topics, and resources needed to upskill efficiently. It covers:
        * **Phase 1:** Fortifying Foundations (Python, Core AI/ML)
        * **Phase 2:** Mastering Google's AI Ecosystem (Vertex AI, Gemini, APIs)
        * **Phase 3:** Specializing in Agentic AI Development (LangChain, AutoGen)
        * **Phase 4:** Best Practices & Portfolio Building (MLOps, Responsible AI)

3.  **[AI Application Developer's Project Workbook](PROJECT_WORKBOOK.md)**
    * A hands-on "cookbook" filled with project ideas, exercises, and challenges directly aligned with the learning path. It provides practical assignments to solidify your understanding and build a strong portfolio.
